Diego-Enabler: CLI Plugin
=====================
**This plugin is for [CLI
v6.13.0+](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).** For CLI v6.12.4 and older, use the
[Diego-Beta](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-cli-plugin) plugin
instead.

This plugin enables Diego support for an app running on Cloud Foundry. For more
information about running apps on Diego, see the [Migrating to Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-design-notes/blob/master/migrating-to-diego.md)
